            <p>
                Enter the course name, grade, credit, and course type of
                of each of your courses. To add more courses, click the
                <u>Add Course</u> button. To remove a course, click on the
                ‚ìç beside the course. If you do not know the credit of a
                course, set it to 1.
                <br><br>
                Note that the course name does not affect the GPA.
                <br><br>
                You can also change the Grade's
                Key by just tapping on the Edit Grade's Key button under
                the Grade's Key. If there are no + and - in letter grades,
                uncheck the + and - letters. Here are the rules of the
                Garde's Key:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A GPA of a higher grade letter cannot be greater
                        than that of a lower grade letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The percentage grade is divided so that it is
                        minimum to maximum grade where minimum grade is
                        inclusive and maximum grade is exclusive, except
                        the first maximum grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum and minimum percentage of the same
                        letter cannot equal to each other
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum percentage of a letter must be greater
                        than the minimum percentage of that same letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum percentage of a lower grade letter must
                        equal to minimum percentage of the letter above it.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <!-- GPA -->
            <h1>What is GPA?</h1>
            <p>
                GPA stands for Grade Average Point. It is a form of way to
                evaluate grades. It is usually used on a 4.0 scaling point,
                meaning that the GPA is calculated out of 4.
            </p>
            <!-- CGPA -->
            <h1>What is CGPA?</h1>
            <p>
                CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Average Point. It is the
                average of all GPAs achieved. For example, CGPA can be
                calculated by getting the average between the first school
                term and the second school term GPAs. Another example is
                getting the average GPA from grade 9 through 12.
            </p>
            <!-- Weighted GPA vs. Unweighted GPA -->
            <h1>
                What is the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Weighted GPA gives more grades to AP, honors, IB, and
                college courses. Unweighted GPA does not give any more
                grades to them. Weighted GPA gives 0.5 GPA more to honors
                courses and 1 GPA more to AP, IB, and college courses. Make
                sure with your school if they give out weighted,
                unweighted, or both GPA.
            </p>
            <!-- Calculate Unweighted GPA -->
            <h1>How do you calculate unweighted GPA?</h1>
            <p>
                The calculation is actually simple.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get the grade percentage or letter of each course
                        and use the Grade's Key to get each course's GPA.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multiply each GPA by the amount of credit of the
                        course. Each course is usually 1 credit hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add all the GPAs of all the courses together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Divide the sum by the total of credit hours taken.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Voila! You have your GPA!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Note that the Grade's Key can vary from school to school.
            </p>
            <!-- Calculate Weighted GPA -->
            <h1>How do you calculate weighted GPA?</h1>
            <p>
                Do the same calculation for as the unweighted GPA, but make
                sure that after step 1 you add 0.5 GPA to honors courses
                and 1 GPA to AP, IB, or college courses.
            </p>
            <!-- AP -->
            <h1>What is AP?</h1>
            <p>
                AP stands for Advanced Placement. It is an series of exams
                made by the <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/">
                College Board</a> that a student can choose from. They
                give a change for the student to take college-level work
                while they are still in school. They can sometimes be
                exchanged fro college credits. For more information, visit
